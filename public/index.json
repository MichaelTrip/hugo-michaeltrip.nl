For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:\n Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow. Favor deep end-to-end accomplishments over broad but incremental steps forward. Focus on taking the right teams far before encouraging broad adoption. Centralize the platforms and tools that your teams shouldn’t be thinking about. Provide foundational services/commodities and let teams stay on purpose. Incorporate contributions from everyone; don’t stifle autonomy. Stay open to new ways of working. Challenge security policies, but respect intentions. Find new ways to enforce concerns without abandoning precaution.

Why? Because i can, and i had some spare time ;-).\nFor a long i wanted to setup a Openshift cluster in my own Homelab. Due to resource limitations i can only run one Openshift node. After many moons of searching and testing, i have found a very convinient way to enroll a single node OpenShift 4.11 (OKD) in my Homelab.\nPreperations First, there are some preperations to be done;\n A machine that can run podman, in my case i have a separate VM called okd4-services which hosts my podman pods. A virtual machine with the following specifications (this is what i have observed as the absolute minimum):  8 vCPU\u0026rsquo;s 24 GB (!!) of memory 100GB disk   If possible, a DHCP reservation on the mac address of the VM. A dns zone that you can use in your own homelab, because OpenShift heavily relies on DNS. This is the dump of my DNS zone called okd.alcatrash.net.  $ORIGIN . okd.alcatrash.net 3600 IN SOA ns1.alcatrash.org hostmaster.okd.alcatrash.net 2022090510 10800 3600 604800 3600 _etcd-server-ssl._tcp.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN SRV 0 10 2380 etcd-0.okd.alcatrash.net api.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 api-int.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 *.apps.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 console-openshift-console.apps.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 oauth-openshift.apps.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 console.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 console-openshift-console.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 etcd-0.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 okd4-control-plane-1.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.201 okd4-services.okd.alcatrash.net 60 IN A 10.99.1.210 As you can see we have several dns entries; 2 times a A record for the hosts okd4-services and the okd4-control-plane-1. The rest are mandatory DNS records needed for OpenShift to work properly. You can take a look here for more information.\nThe podman host must be reachable from the OpenShift node.  Starting the OpenShift Assisted installer So first, login to your podman node. After that, clone the following:\n[michael@okd4-services ~]$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service.git Cloning into \u0026#39;assisted-service\u0026#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 60092, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (24/24), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (23/23), done. remote: Total 60092 (delta 5), reused 10 (delta 0), pack-reused 60068 Receiving objects: 100% (60092/60092), 67.53 MiB | 8.06 MiB/s, done.

[michael@okd4-services ~]$ After that, cd into the assisted-service/deploy/podman directory.\nafter that, take a look in the directory:\n[michael@okd4-services podman]$ ls -lah total 44K drwxrwxr-x. 2 michael michael 185 Oct 5 21:38 . drwxrwxr-x. 12 michael michael 4.0K Oct 5 21:38 .. -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 249 Oct 5 21:38 configmap_tls_certs.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 2.8K Oct 5 21:38 configmap_tls.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 4.6K Oct 5 21:38 configmap.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 1.8K Oct 5 21:38 okd-configmap.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 1.1K Oct 5 21:38 pod-persistent.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 1.6K Oct 5 21:38 pod_tls.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 810 Oct 5 21:38 pod.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 michael michael 4.7K Oct 5 21:38 README.md Here is a file we need to edit.\nEdit the okd-configmap.yml and replace the ASSISTED_SERVICE_HOST, IMAGE_SERVICE_BASE_URL and the SERVICE_BASE_URL variables with the ip address of your host where you run the podman pods on.\nIn my case, it looks something like this:\n[michael@okd4-services podman]$ cat okd-configmap.yml apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:  name: config data:  ASSISTED_SERVICE_HOST: 10.99.1.210:8090  IMAGE_SERVICE_BASE_URL: http://10.99.1.210:8888  SERVICE_BASE_URL: http://10.99.1.210:8090  ASSISTED_SERVICE_SCHEME: http ... After that, the README.md states we need to run the following command for the podman pods to start. podman play kube --configmap okd-configmap.yml pod.yml This run will be without data persistence. Should you require data persistence, than take a look in the README.md on how to proceed.\n[michael@okd4-services podman]$ podman play kube --configmap okd-configmap.yml pod.yml Trying to pull quay.io/centos7/postgresql-12-centos7:latest... Getting image source signatures ....

In my case this is http://10.99.1.210:8080.\nCreating a cluster in the Assisted service / installer After logging in on the web interface, you will see a nice interface:\n   Assisted service Web UI     click on Create New Cluster\nNow you will be shown a screen where you can setup the cluster. Make sure to enter the correct Cluster Name corresponding with your DNS zone. In my case my cluster name will be okd and my base domain will be alcatrash.net.\nAlso make sure to check the box Install single node OpenShift (SNO)\nAfter that, insert the pull secret for the Red Hat container registry. Your pull secret can be retrieved from the https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/create/local url. Login with your Red Hat credentials. After that, you will be prompted with something like this:\n     Get your Pull Secret here   Click on Copy pull secret and paste it into the assisted installer screen.\nAfter that, you can choose for Host networking either DHCP or Static. In this example i have created a DHCP lease for my Openshift node in my router, so i will choose DHCP here.\nAfter that, click Next. After that, you will see the Operators section. We are not going to use any operators from here, so click Next.\nAfter clicking next, you will see the Host discovery screen. Click on the Add Host button. In this menu you can paste your SSH key. Insert your SSH key and choose the minimal image file. After that, you can click the Generate Discovery ISO Button. Now the magic will happen ;-).\n   ISO being generated     At this point, the assisted installer generated a iso that can be used for provisioning the Openshift node.\n   ISO url     Download the ISO by either copying the url or the wget command into your terminal and save the iso. Make sure to save it somewhere where you can mount it on your hypervisor.\nBooting your VM with the ISO At this point we are ready to boot the VM with the ISO attached. In this example i will use Proxmox, as this is my Hypervisor in my homelab.\n   VM is booting     The VM will boot and will call home to the assisted installer service with the provisioned agent on the ISO.\n   agent calling home     After some time the node will appear in the web ui from the assisted installer:\n   Server appears in web ui     After that, we can click Next. The following screen tells you your disks will be formatted.\nClick Next to continue. The following screen will have some network information. You can take a look at it, after that, hit Next.\nNow, you will be presented with the summary screen:\n   summary screen     Click on Install cluster.\nAfter that, you can monitor your progress:\n   Monitoring progress     The complete installation will take up to 60 minutes on modern hardware. Grab a cup of coffee and wait some time ;-)\nAfter waiting, you will be presented with this screen:\n   Installation completed     You will see some information on your screen including the console url and the credentials for the kubeadmin user.\nDone, what now ? After clicking the console url you will encounter some self-signed certificate errors. Ignore these, because it is your homelab ;-).\nafter logging in with the kubeadmin user we can see the shiny web interface of OKD.\n   OKD Web UI     And there it is, your own single node OpenShift / OKD cluster. You can do everything with it, except one thing: upgrading to a new release. That is not possible.\nHave fun! And if you have any questions, please contact me through email / linkedin / github or whatever ;-)\n","permalink":"https://michaeltrip.nl/blog/openshift-sno-in-homelab/","tags":["blog","openshift","kubernetes","homelab"],"title":"Setting up Openshift single node in your own Homelab"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Intro So i passed the CKAD exam last september. In this blog i wanted to share some tips.\nLearning matters For me personally i am the type of guy that learns by just doing it. Set up some Kubernetes node with either Kind or Rancher Desktop and just try some things out.\nAlso, check out some great Udemy courses. I personally liked this CKAD course by Mumshad Mannambeth.\nAlso, try some practice exercises from the internet. I just looked some of those up on Github:\n https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises https://github.com/jamesbuckett/ckad-questions  Also, if you have booked the exam, you are also entitled to use the Exam simulator by killer.sh. If you log-in on the site of the Linux Foundation there is a link to that exam simulator. You have 2 shots.\nUse autocompletion in your bashrc When you are working on the CKAD exam, speed is everything. You have approx 15-17 questions to do within two hours, so time is crucial.\nYou can speed things up by using auto-completion in your shell. To do so, enable auto completion for kubectl in your .bashrc.\necho \u0026#34;source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc # add autocomplete permanently to your bash shell. After that, you can hit the button on your keyboard to autocomplete commands. If you are tired of of typing in the whole kubectl command you can also alias that command.\necho \u0026#34;alias k=kubectl\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc echo \u0026#34;complete -F __start_kubectl k\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc More information can be found in the Kubectl cheatsheet, which you can also use on the exam.\nUse bookmarks in your browser The exam you are about to take is a web-based exam. You are allowed to have one tab open besides your exam tab. This can either be one of the following sites:\n https://kubernetes.io/docs/ https://github.com/kubernetes/ https://kubernetes.io/blog/  To make things easier, you are allowed to use bookmarks in your browser. I have created some bookmarks that you can import in your browser. You can find them here.\nUse kubectl expose This is a odd one, but i found it very usable. When you create a pod or a deployment you want it to be served some how. To do this, you can quickly create a service for this pod or deployment.\nFor example: I have a pod called nginx. To create a service for it, i can use kubectl expose.\nkubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --name=servicename Or, if you want a yaml file to edit it and create some more service parameters, use the following command:\nkubectl expose pod nginx --port --name=servicename --dry-run=client -o yaml \u0026gt; service.yml Use a alias to quickly switch to another namespace Exam quests will take place in different namespaces and contexts. If there is a question that doesn´t mention a namespace, always use the default namespace.\nYou can switch namespaces by typing this command:\nkubectl config set-context --current --namespace namespacename A bit long, isn´t it? To make life easier i use a alias you can add to your .bashrc.\necho \u0026#39;alias kn=\u0026#34;kubectl config set-context --current --namespace\u0026#34;\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.bashrc Create your own .vimrc If you use vim as your favorite editor, it is important to use the right configuration. You can edit your .vimrc in your home folder. I used the following settings:\nset nu # set numbers set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab # use 2 spaces instead of tab set ai # autoindent: when go to new line keep same indentation set cursorcolumn # You see a column on your cursor so you can easily check the identation. Some other tips Stay hydrated You are allowed to have a glass or a bottle of water next to you. Mind that this bottle or glass needs to be transparent.\nClean up your desk before taking the exam I started the exam 15 minutes before and cleaned up my desk. But, i left my audio speakers on the desk. The proctor asked me to also remove these audio speakers. So please, clean up your desk and remove everything from your desk besides your keyboard, mouse and your laptop.\nCheck your questions before you begin Go through all the questions and begin with the easiest ones first. After that, you have plenty of time to start with the hard questions.\nCheck in which context you have to use At the beginning of every question, it states in which context you will work in. There is also a copy button with to command that you can use. Use this button, it will save you a lot of time.\n","permalink":"https://michaeltrip.nl/blog/setting-up-kubernetes/","tags":["kubernetes","Homelab"],"title":"Tips on the CKAD exam"},{"categories":null,"contents":"BOSH (Bosh Outer SHell) \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;is an open source tool for release engineering, deployment, lifecycle management, and monitoring of distributed systems.\u0026rdquo; And it\u0026rsquo;s amazingly powerful.
