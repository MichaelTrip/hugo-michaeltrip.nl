      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc). Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>Intro So i passed the CKAD exam last september. In this blog i wanted to share some tips.

Also, check out some great Udemy courses. I personally liked this CKAD course by Mumshad Mannambeth.
Also, try some practice exercises from the internet.</description>
