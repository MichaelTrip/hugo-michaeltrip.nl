      <description>Intro So the other day i tried to update my k3s cluster running at the Oracle Cloud. Somehow, my Postgres statefulset crashed and the postmaster.pid file was not removed properly. Anyway, the pod was restarted but was now in a CrashLoopBackOff stage. The error message stated that the lock file couldnÂ´t be removed. So how do you remove a file from a PersistentVolumeClaim with the container constantly restarting? I found something.</description>

      <description>Intro So i wanted to run OpenShift in my Homelab. Why? Because i can, and i had some spare time ;-).
For a long i wanted to setup a Openshift cluster in my own Homelab. Due to resource limitations i can only run one Openshift node. After many moons of searching and testing, i have found a very convinient way to enroll a single node OpenShift 4.11 (OKD) in my Homelab.</description>

      <description>Intro So i passed the CKAD exam last september. In this blog i wanted to share some tips.
Learning matters For me personally i am the type of guy that learns by just doing it. Set up some Kubernetes node with either Kind or Rancher Desktop and just try some things out.
Also, check out some great Udemy courses. I personally liked this CKAD course by Mumshad Mannambeth.
Also, try some practice exercises from the internet.</description>
